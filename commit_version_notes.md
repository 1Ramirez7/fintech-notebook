**15 - Commit # 15**

- follow steps for making env and variables for repo (word doc file instructions)

I did not do the final step of downloading/moving the tinytex file.

I follow the steps but for some reason tinytex::tinytex_root() 
was still showing the local path and not the new repo path. since it not work I deleted everything with this step so I just start from scratch when I do it again. 

- I remove files for Stock_screening and made repo for it.

**16 - I re-added sql folder to be able to use the same raw links 16**

- The QuantGazer repo is private so I can't use the raw links in that repo until it is public. 

- So I re-added the sql folder here. No edits should be made in this folder and it should always be a copy of the sql folder in QuantGazer.
