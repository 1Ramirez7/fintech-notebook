- follow steps for making env and variables for repo (word doc file instructions)

I did not do the final step of downloading/moving the tinytex file.

I follow the steps but for some reason tinytex::tinytex_root() 
was still showing the local path and not the new repo path. since it not work I deleted everything with this step so I just start from scratch when I do it again. 

- I remove files for Stock_screening and made repo for it.
