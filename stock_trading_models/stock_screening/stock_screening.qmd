My goal is to build a shiny app that where I can see the list of biggest winners and biggest losers. 
- Also get their sector and sub sector
- also get company description
- also get volume total and volume as a percentage of shares outstanding
  
Also get list of biggest trades by volume and volume as a % of shares outstanding. 


The main goal of this is just to paint a picture of the biggest moves in the market. 

# Step 1

I need to build code to get closing prices for stocks 

**What I need** 

I need a list of all US equity stocks. Code juse uses US equity so I either have a list with just symbols or remove US EQUITY with code before running.

```{python}

import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Load Excel file
file_path = r"ticker_sample.xlsx"
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Define time frame
start_date = "2024-05-13"
end_date = "2024-06-07"

# Get daily closing prices with each date in its own column
def get_closing_prices(ticker):
    try:
        data = yf.Ticker(ticker).history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
        closes = data["Close"]
        closes.index = closes.index.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        return closes
    except:
        return pd.Series()

# Apply and expand into separate columns
closes_df = df["ticker"].apply(get_closing_prices).apply(pd.Series)
closes_df.columns.name = None

# Combine and save
result = pd.concat([df, closes_df], axis=1)
result.to_excel(r"ticker_sample_closes.xlsx", index=False)




```













# Useful codes




**This cell displays all informationa availbale vie yfinance**

```{python}
# This cell displays all informationa availbale vie yfinance
import yfinance as yf

# Get full info for CVX
info = yf.Ticker("CVX").info

# Print all keys and values in sorted order
for key in sorted(info.keys()):
    print(f"{key}: {info[key]}")




```



**This chunk gets Setor and industry names.**

```{python}
# This chunk gets Setor and industry names.
# ticker column must just have ticker symbol only

import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Load Excel file
file_path = r"ticker_sample.xlsx"
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Get sector and industry info
def get_sector_industry(ticker):
    try:
        info = yf.Ticker(ticker).info
        return pd.Series([info.get("sector"), info.get("industry")])
    except:
        return pd.Series([None, None])

# Apply to Ticker column
df[["Sector", "Industry"]] = df["ticker"].apply(get_sector_industry)

# Save updated file
output_path = r"ticker_sample_one.xlsx"
df.to_excel(output_path, index=False)
